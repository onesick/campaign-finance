# Project 3 Evaluation

I'll be referencing [this rubric](https://github.com/ga-dc/project3/blob/master/evaluation.md) throughout your project evaluation.

## Back-End Technology

#### Progressing

You're back-end code looks good and you successfully implemented a Candidate model. While you did have a good amount of code for your User model, it was not implemented in your application, so I was not able to test it. That being said, it looks like you have most of the code required for it. Happy to pair with you guys on implementing this properly if you'd like.

## Front-End Technology

#### Performing

Your app looks great and does a good job of transforming data you pull in from an AJAX request into visually-appealing information in the browser. You started an OOJS approach and even made use of the fetch method in your model. That was the extent, however, of how you utilized your model and view files. I would put fully implementing OOJS at the top of your refactoring to-do list. This entails, among other things, (1) using your model to fully represent candidate data and (2) using your view to not only render your candidates upon page load but also handle all functionality that result from user interaction.

## Code Quality

#### Progressing

While your code was properly formatted, styled and indented throughout your application, you left A LOT of unused code and files in there. This made it somewhat difficult to figure out which code you were actually using in your application. I would strongly encourage you to remove unused code/files from your master branch. If you would like to keep them (which I would encourage in the case of User-related files), move them to a separate branch(es).

I left specific code comments in a pull request to your repo. You can see them [here](https://github.com/onesick/campaign-finance/pull/4). No need to merge the pull request.

## Deployment and Functionality

#### Performing

From the looks of it, you guys achieved the functionality you sought out to implement. Good job! Based on our conversations, I think you guys are capable of implementing the next round of features you were hoping to get to. Props on deploying your application too. It looks, however, like it's unable to connect with your API. Perhaps we can diagnose this if there's time during our project retro!

## Planning / Process / Submission

#### Progressing

Solid job with planning. I like how you started with that planning directory and sent over to me on day one! Your repo, however, does not include a Readme. Can't stress enough how important these are. Not only does it give me, other developers or potential employers an idea of what your app is all about, but you can also include installation instructions (e.g., Here's how to set up an env.js file. You'll need an API key from the NYT.).
